# Solar System


This project try to simulate a solar system in 2D.

To implement this system, I have used C++ and the SFML library to create the execution window.

## Auto-executable file

In the "executable" folder, you can find a file that will extract a folder. By executing the extracted file "Metaballs.exe", you can test the application in real time.
